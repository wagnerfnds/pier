// A new agent can't read a prompt yet. It is still drawing, or, in a
// folder it hasn't seen, it asks first whether to trust it (Claude Code,
// Codex). That question takes keys only. Text typed into it is dropped,
// and the Enter after it answers the question: Claude Code highlights
// "No, exit", so a prompt sent then ends the session before the prompt it
// was started with (on its command line, which the agent keeps until it
// is trusted) ever runs.
//
// So while an agent session starts, pierd watches its screen. A send waits
// until the agent has drawn. While a startup question shows, prompts are
// held in the session's inbox, typed once the person has answered and the
// agent is at its prompt, and the screen poller leaves its turn alone.

// startupQuestions are the words of those questions. notify: the chat is
// told the agent waits (agent.waiting). Codex's numbered menu isn't, so the
// chat opens its own screen for it, as it did before, rather than offering
// its options as buttons (a digit picks one there, but Enter confirms).
