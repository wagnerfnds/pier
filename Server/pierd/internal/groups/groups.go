// Package groups gives what pierd starts the groups its user joined after
// pierd started.
//
// A process's groups are fixed when it starts: they come from its parent,
// and only a login (login, sshd, su) reads the group database again. So when
// a team setup's docker step adds the box's user to the docker group,
// pierd keeps the groups it started with, and so does everything it starts:
// tmux and every terminal, services, scripts. A login shell started by
// pierd (`$SHELL -lc`) is no help, since it inherits them too, and nor is
// restarting pierd under its service manager: a systemd user unit gets the
// user manager's groups, read once when the user's first session began, and
// a launchd agent its own, so the restarted pierd lacks the group as well.
// tmux's server, which every terminal is forked from, could only take the
// group by being restarted, which would end every terminal.
//
// What does work without a password is sg(1): it is setuid, and gives a
// group its caller is listed in by the group database. So pierd compares
// the groups the database gives its user with its own, and when some are
// missing, runs each new terminal, service, script and hook through sg, one
// sg per missing group, then once more for the user's own primary group,
// so files it makes keep their usual group. Nothing that already runs is
// touched; it gets the group when it is next started, or at the next login.
